# v-shark
V-shark is a remote monitoring and vulnerability assessment tool that can be used to monitor the remote systems with the help of a very small Window Utility. It can monitor the system for all the threats and vulnerabilities that might work like a backdoor for trojans, malwares and for hackers to sneak into your system and corrupt your data.

This tool will actively keep monitoring your system for open ports, firewall status, AV Status, Open Applications etc. and will update the admin with the help of a centralised dashboard which the admin can take an action on.

** What is Vulnerability Assessment **
Vulnerability scanning or vulnerability assessment is a systematic process of finding security loopholes in any system addressing the potential vulnerabilities.

The purpose of vulnerability assessments is to prevent the possibility of unauthorized access to systems. Vulnerability testing preserves the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system. The system refers to any computers, networks, network devices, software, web application, cloud computing, etc.

## Types of Vulnerability Scanners
Vulnerability scanners have their ways of doing jobs. We can classify the vulnerability scanners into four types based on how they operate.

### Cloud-Based Vulnerability Scanners
Used to find vulnerabilities within cloud-based systems such as web applications, WordPress, and Joomla.

### Host-Based Vulnerability Scanners
Used to find vulnerabilities on a single host or system such as an individual computer or a network device like a switch or core-router.

### Network-Based Vulnerability Scanners
Used to find vulnerabilities in an internal network by scanning for open ports. Services running on open ports determined whether vulnerabilities exist or not with the help of the tool.

### Database-Based Vulnerability Scanners
Used to find vulnerabilities in database management systems. Databases are the backbone of any system storing sensitive information. Vulnerability scanning is performed on database systems to prevent attacks like SQL Injection.

## Advantages of Scanning for Vulnerabilities
Vulnerability scanning keeps systems secure from external threats. Other benefits include:

*Affordable* â€“ Many vulnerability scanners are available free of charge.

*Quick* â€“ Assessment takes a few hours to complete.

*Automate* â€“ can use automated functions available in the vulnerability tools to perform scans regularly without manual involvement.

*Performance* â€“ vulnerability scanners perform almost all the well-known vulnerability scan.

*Cost/Benefit* â€“ reduce cost and increase benefits by optimizing security threats.

Check ``CONTRIBUTING.md`` for contributing guidelines


## Steps to follow to start Contributing :scroll:

### 0. Star The Repo :star2:

Star the repo by pressing the topmost-right button to start your wonderful journey.


### 1. Fork the repo :fork_and_knife:

You can get your own fork/copy of  <a href="https://github.com/devclub-biet-jhansi/Online-ResumeBuilder">Online ResumeBuilder</a> by using the <kbd><b>Fork</b></kbd> button at top-right of your screen.


### 2. Clone it to your local machine :busts_in_silhouette:

`NOTE: commands are to be executed on Linux, Mac, and Windows(using Powershell)`

You need to clone (download) it to local machine using

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/devclub-biet-jhansi/Online-ResumeBuilder.git
```

> This makes a local copy of the repository in your machine.

Once you have cloned the ` Online-ResumeBuilder ` repository in Github, move to that folder first using change directory command on Linux, Mac, and Windows(PowerShell to be used).

```sh
# This will change directory to a folder Online-ResumeBuilder
$ cd Online-ResumeBuilder
```

Move to this folder for all other commands.

Now Make your contribution on the project and commit your changes to a new branch

### 3. Create a new branch :bangbang:

Whenever you are going to contribute. Please create a separate branch using command and keep your `master` branch clean (i.e. synced with remote branch).

```sh
# It will create a new branch with name Branch_Name and switch to branch Folder_Name
$ git checkout -b BranchName
```

Create a separate branch for contribution and try to use the same name of the branch as of folder.

To switch to the desired branch

```sh
# To switch from one folder to other
$ git checkout BranchName
```

To add the changes to the branch. Use

```sh
# To add all files to branch Folder_Name
$ git add .
```

Type in a message relevant for the code reviewer using

```sh
# This message get associated with all files you have changed
$ git commit -m 'relevant message'
```

Now, Push your awesome work to your remote repository using

```sh
# To push your work to your remote repository
$ git push -u origin BranchName
```

Finally, go to your repository in the browser and click on `compare and pull requests`.
Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your precious effort.

 Always feel free to drop a comment or create an issue if you find something missing. Our excellent contributors will always get it done.
 
 Happy Coding ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰
